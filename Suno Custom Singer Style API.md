# Suno Custom Singer Style API Integration Instructions

SUNO allows us to set a singer style for songs that have already been generated, and then create secondary creations based on it. This document explains the integration method for the related APIs.

This API has only three input parameters: first, `audio_id`, which is the ID of a song that has been successfully generated by the official tool; second, `name` and `description`, which serve as a name and description for the singer style.

The `audio_id` we input is `https://cdn.acedata.cloud/2qhzs3.png`, which can refer to [Suno Audios Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/4da95d9d-7722-4a72-857d-bf6be86036e9) for custom song generation, and finally, obtain the `audio_id`.

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/suno/persona' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "name": "test",
  "audio_id": "81745564-60e7-4ad4-85a9-6f42f0f4f3b3",
  "description": "test"
}'
```

The result is as follows:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "8e808558-f056-456f-91d6-b97fd94eb3be",
  "data": {
    "persona_id": "dae4ae5d-2b51-4af1-b286-1a4473ef4dba"
  }
}
```

As we can see, the `persona_id` field in `data` is the generated singer style ID.

With the singer style ID, we can then use the [Suno Audios Generation API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/4da95d9d-7722-4a72-857d-bf6be86036e9) to generate custom songs. For example, the `action` can pass in `artist_consistency`, while the `audio_id` passes in the uploaded song ID. We also need to upload the parameter `persona_id`, which is the singer style ID returned above, in order to generate new songs based on the reference singer style.
